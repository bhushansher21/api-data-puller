Notes are included below. \r\n\r\n### What is the entrypoint for the user?\r\n\r\nThe application flow beings with the addition of a new variable, `outputFile`\r\n\r\n```golang\r\ncmd.Flags().StringVarP(\u0026outputFile, \"output\", \"w\", \"\", \"output file to write to (default writes to STDOUT).\")\r\n```\r\nIt's a string, the default being empty, that if not empty, will serve two purposes:\r\n\r\n  - serve as a boolean to indicate we want to write to file\r\n  - the string variable itself provides the path to the file.\r\n\r\nWith any write to file it goes without saying we don't want to overwrite by default, but we can give the user a `--force` variable to push it.\r\n\r\n```golang\r\ncmd.Flags().BoolVar(\u0026forceWrite, \"force\", false, \"force overwrite output file, if exists already.\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Variable Choices\r\n\r\nI chose `output` for the command line flag (`--output`) because it reads nicely into a sentence, e.g., \"--output=/path/to/file.json\" reads to output goes to this file path. I also chose `w` for the single character (well, o was taken) but also because `w`  can also stand for \"write,\" sort of like the `gofmt -w \u003cfile\u003e` command.  So \"-w /path/to/file.json\" reads to \"write to this file path).\r\n\r\n### What is the Client Flow?\r\n\r\nThe flag is revealed as an option `--output` if we do `analyze` or `diff`. Note that I also added a `force` option in the case that the file exists. The user can choose to overwrite it with `--force`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./out/container-diff analyze --help\r\nAnalyzes an image using the specifed analyzers as indicated via flags (see documentation for available ones).\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n  container-diff analyze [flags]\r\n\r\nFlags:\r\n  -c, --cache-dir string   cache directory base to create .container-diff (default is $HOME).\r\n      --force              force overwrite output file, if exists already.\r\n  -h, --help               help for analyze\r\n  -j, --json               JSON Output defines if the diff should be returned in a human readable format (false) or a JSON (true).\r\n  -n, --no-cache           Set this to force retrieval of image filesystem on each run.\r\n  -o, --order              Set this flag to sort any file/package results by descending size.

(Use the force, logrus)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./out/container-diff analyze --output /tmp/file.txt --force ubuntu\r\n```\r\n(Note no error messages).\r\n\r\nWe can do all of the above but specify json output.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./out/container-diff analyze --output /tmp/file.json --json ubuntu\r\n$ cat /tmp/file.json \r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"Image\": \"ubuntu\",\r\n    \"AnalyzeType\": \"Size\",\r\n    \"Analysis\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"Name\": \"ubuntu\",\r\n        \"Digest\": \"sha256:acd85db6e4b18aafa7fcde5480872909bd8e6d5fbd4e5e790ecc09acc06a8b78\",\r\n        \"Size\": 71945016\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./out/container-diff analyze --output/tmp/file.json --json ubuntu\r\nERRO[0001] file exist, will not overwrite.              \r\n```\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./out/container-diff analyze --output /tmp/file.json --force --json ubuntu\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that's about it!

I've been thinking about oras-py and I'm looking for some feedback. Specifically I think we should remove the oras-py client commands (and refactor them to be examples). The reason is because it's redundant to maintain two clients, and in practice I've found basic custom implementations (that are done to do exactly what some snowflake registry or interaction needs) are better than trying to provide one command to fit them all. I think the original intention of oras-py was to have a python API to interact with oras, and not to provide yet-another-command-line-tool (I just didn't think about this at the time of creation). As a quick example, I have a custom cache for a tool that can assemble metadata https://github.com/converged-computing/cloud-select/blob/main/cloud_select/main/cache.py#L81-L107 and then use by subclass of the oras provider to push! https://github.com/converged-computing/cloud-select/blob/db02c4378f06bfbbe9df6b8a83c885cc9238a04e/cloud_select/main/cache.py#L81 and I'm wrapping the set_basic_auth that I get from the environment and making sure the user has provided exactly what I need. And then I get my data with (the Go variant) of oras if I need a command line client!\r\n\r\nI am confident this is a better design for the library moving forward - it doesn't make sense from a maintainer standpoint to provide two clients in different languages. If someone wants to push from the command line using oras, they should use https://github.com/oras-project/oras. If they need interactions with oras from their Python software, this is what the SDK is intended for.  Since this is a fairly big change / bump, we are moving to version 0.1.0 for this eventual release.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-10 20:46:26 UTC"},{"title":"add workflow dispatch to python docs update","issue_url":"https://github.com/oras-project/oras-www/pull/73","repo_name":"oras-project/oras-www","body":"This will allow a manual trigger to update the python docs, which is nice to keep them closer in sync.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch \u003cvsoch@users.noreply.github.com\u003e","created_at":"2022-12-10 21:14:38 UTC"},{"title":"Add workflow dispatch to update Python docs","issue_url":"https://github.com/oras-project/oras-www/pull/72","repo_name":"oras-project/oras-www","body":"In addition to the schedule, I'd like to be able to trigger an update of the workflow to update the Python docs so it can more closely coincide with library changes.

E.g., it's not terrible to use a default GitHub pages theme, but I want our project portal to look as great as possible.\r\n\r\nHere is a quick overview of what the site looks like. The main portal presents the current set of projects. This entire page is programmatically derived, meaning that a nightly job runs (also added here) that will retrieve updated metadata. This is why it's important, for each project, to ensure it has description, tags, and a website. Anything added on the repo will update here from now on.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/814322/208280020-6647ab8b-ab80-4d12-8915-33fb092d1392.png)\r\n\r\nI angst-ed about the width of those cards a bit - first because it felt weird putting more content outside of the cards (e.g., releases) and I settled on making them their own card (which stays static when you search/fitler). Next because the page will adjust to the browser width and I tried to get one that looked best on the largest number of widths. If you want to play with it, look for `.card` under `assets/css/style.css`. That search box searches across terms in the description as well as tags and the repo names. Here are the newly added `_data` that generate the above:\r\n\r\n```\r\n_data/data/\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2022\r\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 12\r\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-activity_commits.json\r\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-activity_lines.json\r\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-languages.json\r\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-releases.json\r\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-repo_metadata.json\r\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-repos.json\r\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-stars.json\r\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-topics.json\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2023\r\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ latest\r\n    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-activity_commits.json\r\n    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-activity_lines.json\r\n    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-languages.json\r\n    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-releases.json\r\n    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-repo_metadata.json\r\n    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-repos.json\r\n    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-stars.json\r\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cci-topics.json\r\n\r\n4 directories, 16 files\r\n```\r\n\"latest\" is saved nightly, and then I am asking contributor ci to save the data files monthly, so eventually we would have 12 directories for each year. If you don't want this frequency, we can change to yearly, but I thought it would be interesting to have temporal data. It isn't an incredibly huge amount so we wouldn't need to worry about repo size for a long time. Next, here are the publications:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/814322/208280083-d739b08d-d96b-41ee-aea7-4b7b7509b0d8.png)\r\n\r\nand releases pages:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/814322/208280097-f852361d-f463-41ca-9266-17a39b2c8dde.png)\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few releases, so I added a search box to the top to filter them down. What you can't see is that mousing over one highlights it in a nice blue:\r\n\r\n![highlight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/814322/208280124-e752f6a7-a348-4a2a-8c1f-c0c572b3221a.png)\r\n\r\nI don't know if that adds any value but it looks cool? :laughing: I also modified the listing so clicking anywhere on the line will go to the release page. Here is an example release page:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/814322/208280150-3224ddc9-7316-42e2-b620-10da7fad8454.png)\r\n\r\nNote that I added a next/previous link on the bottom of the page in case someone wants to browse through time. Some of the more empty pages look a little too empty, but when there is good content like the above it looks good! I also ran spell check on all these (and fixed the errors) and added an action that will run nightly. We likely should add spell check to all the projects on the NEWS.md and docs and the general docs so we don't let any errors sneak in. I can do this if it's desired (let me know). Next, here is the about page, which again links to the projects and encourages the user to visit the repo here for feedback, etc. I thought it would be cool to show breakdown of projects by languages (C anyone?)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/814322/208280293-4a7f3579-9988-48e2-aff4-8826cbbd67e6.png)\r\n\r\nThat's part of the contributor ci package, which is the same repo that derives our data. A nice side effect of that is that I can add a static API to the site itself - the same data that populates the content and makes the graphics, for anyone that wants to use (courtesy of GitHub requests lol)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/814322/208280229-9a25beed-ac00-43f3-ad23-5888ba03ed5f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nStill remaining to do is dark mode isn't added yet, and likely there should be more in the readme for developers to contribute to the site. I just ran out of steam - it's almost 9 and I haven't eaten today yet. That happens a lot. :P \r\n\r\nNext steps - this is a LOT to review in a PR, so my suggestion is to clone this branch, and render locally and look around. E.g.,\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone -b update-ui https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-framework.github.io\r\n$ cd flux-framework.github.io\r\n$ bundle install\r\n$ bundle exec jekyll serve\r\n```\r\n \r\nIf you don't have bundle / gem / jekyll  here are the basics https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/.\r\n\r\nLet me know your feedback! Really glad I got to work on this today - would have been earlier but I was struggle-bussing with spack. I'm going to open issues now for dark mode and spell checking on the other project repos so we don't forget!\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch \u003cvsoch@users.noreply.github.com\u003e","created_at":"2022-12-18 03:46:26 UTC"},{"title":"adding more tests for querying, and new command for a dbshell","issue_url":"https://github.com/converged-computing/cloud-select/pull/17","repo_name":"converged-computing/cloud-select","body":"And a tutorial!\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch \u003cvsoch@users.noreply.github.com\u003e","created_at":"2022-12-13 22:54:36 UTC"},{"title":"adding skeleton for showcase","issue_url":"https://github.com/USRSE/usrse.github.io/pull/627","repo_name":"USRSE/usrse.github.io","body":"Heyo website group!

But for automation I definitely wanted to authenticate! So I started to look into \"how to authenticate with the GitHub API\" and stumbled on your script here:\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/aec35009ed55c2fa1c597b7249d1957f206e3ab7/hack/install_kustomize.sh#L137-L142\r\n\r\nBut the request using curl doesn't give any opportunity to actually add a token, so there was no way to respond! \r\n\r\nSolution: I thought it would be easy enough to check for GITHUB_TOKEN in the environment, and if present, to add it as a header. For my own workflows, when I modified the script and did this, that error (which was showing up more times than not) has gone away. So I think (assuming that others would want this in automation) this would be good to have! Here is an example use case from my workflow:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n    - name: Build and Install Operator\r\n      env:\r\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\r\n      run: |\r\n        make \r\n        make manifests\r\n        make kustomize\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm a new contributor here so please let me know what else you need me to do.

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Avro a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AVRO/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"AVRO-XXXX: [component] Title of the pull request\", where *AVRO-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. \r\n    The *component* is optional, but can help identify the correct reviewers faster: either the language (\"java\", \"python\") or subsystem such as \"build\" or \"doc\" are good candidates.  \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests. You can [build the entire project](https://github.com/apache/avro/blob/master/BUILD.md) or just the [language-specific SDK](https://avro.apache.org/project/how-to-contribute/#unit-tests).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Every commit message references Jira issues in their subject lines. In addition, commits follow the guidelines from [How to write a good git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n    1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request improves file read performance by buffering data, fixing AVRO-XXXX.)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick one of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n- *Extended interop tests to verify consistent valid schema names between SDKs*\r\n- *Added test that validates that Java throws an AvroRuntimeException on invalid binary data*\r\n- *Manually verified the change by building the website and checking the new redirect*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

Actual implementation will come later once after we get agreement on the migration paths.\r\n\r\n1. `@swc/core` v2 \r\n\r\n- `swc_cli` will be built as native binary, supports a single subcommand `compile` which current `@swc/cli` supports.\r\n- `@swc/core`'s platform specific optional deps will includes binary to swc_cli for each platform\r\n- `@swc/cli` provides interop to subcommand-less invocation\r\n```\r\n// pseudo \r\n// `@swc/cli/index.ts\r\n\r\nif (args[0] != 'compile') {\r\n  console.warn(`deprecated: v3 will require to invoke cli with subcommand only');\r\n  exec('swc_cli_bin', 'compile', ...args);\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n exec('swc_cli_bin', ...args);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. `@swc/core` v3\r\n- retiring, let `@swc/cli` mark as deprecated \r\n- `@swc/core` specifics `bin` property in package.json to point native binary directly or have wrapper shell script to do those.

It have several stages of test environment setup for its features like test isolation in vm, transpilation support etcs. In result, each bootstrap to jest takes amount of time always. In case of cargo test per each test cases generated as temporary js test suite we spin up new node.js processes with jest per each file. This effectively makes jest's test isolation not required but still have to spend process warmup time per each file. \r\n\r\nMocha in opposite it is lightweight test runner does not provide those functionaility, instead performs quite faster when it comes to bootstrap. Since Mocha doesn't provide any assertions by default we can use jest's assertion library without replacing lot of test cases. (Actually one 1 test case accessing global jest. need to be updated).\r\n\r\nHere's brief execution time comparision between 2 when running `swc_ecma_transforms_compat`. It's from local machine and I think number may vary on CI but also shows obvious gain.\r\n\r\n(`hyperfine -w 3 \"cargo test --package swc_ecma_transforms_compat\"`)\r\n```\r\n//mocha\r\n\r\nBenchmark 1: cargo test --package swc_ecma_transforms_compat\r\n  Time (mean ¬± œÉ):     17.259 s ¬±  1.893 s    [User: 129.996 s, System: 17.067 s]\r\n  Range (min ‚Ä¶ max):   14.240 s ‚Ä¶ 19.987 s    10 runs\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n//jest\r\n\r\nBenchmark 1: cargo test --package swc_ecma_transforms_compat\r\n  Time (mean ¬± œÉ):     116.293 s ¬±  2.252 s    [User: 846.903 s, System: 281.885 s]\r\n  Range (min ‚Ä¶ max):   114.217 s ‚Ä¶ 121.382 s    10 runs\r\n```\r\n\r\n**PR doesn't replace jest for node-swc tests**: I cannot 100% sure if there's specific reason to use jest for those legit node.js side test cases. For now PR doesn't touch it, depends on usecases we _may_ replace it.

This patch fixes the problem on Linux by using `timer_create()` with `SIGEV_THREAD_ID`, as suggested by @nikic.\r\n\r\nAlso, this patch uses `SIGIO` instead of `SIGPROF` [to prevent messing with profilers](https://externals.io/message/118859#118881). This also improves [the compatibility of PHP with Go](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/56260) (which is important for [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev)). Why hijack `SIGIO`? Because [there is no good way to choose this signal, and `SIGIO` is probably the safest signal in our case](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.4/src/runtime/signal_unix.go#L71) (`SIGURG` is already used internally by Go for its non-cooperative preemption feature).\r\n\r\nThis fix only works for Linux because Mac and BSD don't implement `timer_create()`. It may be possible to use libdispatch on Mac and FreeBSD to achieve something similar, but it's out of scope for this patch.\r\n\r\nIt's safe to merge this in 8.1 because the new system is only enabled for Linux ZTS builds, and timeouts are currently totally broken for this platform.\r\n\r\nI wrote a test in FrankenPHP proving that this patch fixes the problem: https://github.com/dunglas/frankenphp/pull/128\r\nI'm not sure how (and if it's necessary) to write a test for this in PHP.

I tried setting it up as  a global variable but that did not work (most probably because each script executes in a separate environment).\r\n* `TMusafaBitmap.ResizeBilinear` produces inferior results to `TBitmap.StretchDraw` and that impacts the predictions significantly (the classifier works on 32x32 images).\r\n* The result of the model are not stable (I don't know whether that's a problem in neural-api or an incompatibility with the execution environments, it'll take a deeper debugging to find out).\r\n\r\nHere is a little Simba script showcasing the behaviour of the new method:\r\n\r\n```pascal\r\nprogram classifyexample;\r\nvar\r\n  m: TMufasaBitmap;\r\n  labels: TStringArray;\r\n  scores: TSingleArray;\r\n  bestMatch: String;\r\n  i: Integer;\r\nbegin\r\n  for i := 1 to 10 do\r\n  begin\r\n    m := TMufasaBitmap.CreateFromFile('/path/to/some/image/with/a/pear');\r\n    m.ClassifyBitmap(labels,scores,bestMatch);\r\n    WriteLn(bestMatch);\r\n    m.Free;\r\nend;\r\nend.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo see all the scores:\r\n\r\n```pascal\r\nprogram classifyexample;\r\nvar\r\n  m: TMufasaBitmap;\r\n  labels: TStringArray;\r\n  scores: TSingleArray;\r\n  bestMatch: String;\r\n  i: Integer;\r\nbegin\r\n  m := TMufasaBitmap.CreateFromFile('/path/to/some/image');\r\n  m.ClassifyBitmap(labels,scores,bestMatch);\r\n  for i := Low(scores) to High(scores) do\r\n     WriteLn(i, ' ', labels[i], ': ', scores[i]);\r\n  WriteLn(bestMatch);\r\n  m.Free;\r\nend.\r\n```","created_at":"2022-12-24 00:53:07 UTC"},{"title":"Fixed GnomasLand link","issue_url":"https://github.com/grahamwaters/seeking-contributors/pull/5","repo_name":"grahamwaters/seeking-contributors","body":"Somehow the one project I was interested in checking out had the wrong link.

This reads both files, doing a hash comparison before\r\n  deciding to write or not.\r\n- Delete the temp file.\r\n\r\nSometimes the temp file is actually in `%TEMP%`, but other times we\r\nappend `.new` to the destination file. The case of `.new` can collide\r\nif two builds are running at once (example caused by a known VS for\r\nMac issue).\r\n\r\nThinking about this, in cases with small files, we can make a simple\r\noptimization:\r\n\r\n- Generate the file in-memory.\r\n- Use a new `MonoAndroidHelper.CopyStreamIfChanged` method`.\r\n\r\nThis has several benefits:\r\n\r\n- We never write a file to disk when there are no changes.\r\n- We don't have to *remember* to delete the file.\r\n- The code, in general, is slightly simpler.\r\n\r\nThe only place we likely shouldn't use this new pattern, would be if\r\nthe file was huge.\r\n\r\n## Changes ##\r\n\r\nI added new APIs for:\r\n\r\n- `Files.HasStreamChanged` - to compare a `Stream` in memory\r\n- `Files.HasBytesChanged` - to compare a `byte[]` in memory\r\n- `Files.CopyIfStreamChanged`\r\n- `Files.CopyIfStringChanged` - some cases we have a `string`\r\n- `Files.CopyIfBytesChanged` - this supports `string`\r\n- `MonoAndroidHelper.CopyIfStreamChanged`\r\n- `MonoAndroidHelper.CopyIfStringChanged`\r\n- `MonoAndroidHelper.CopyIfBytesChanged`\r\n\r\nI changed the following MSBuild tasks, mostly to test out the new\r\nbehavior:\r\n\r\n- `GenerateResourceDesigner` was using a `.new` file.\r\n- `GenerateJavaStubs` was using temp files in many places. I was able\r\n  to fix up all of these.\r\n- `ManifestDocument` now has an overload for `Save` that takes a\r\n  `Stream`\r\n- `Generator` now uses `CopyIfStreamChanged` a new\r\n  `GetDestinationPath` method from java.interop. It reuses a single\r\n  `MemoryStream`, and I moved the `GenerateJavaSource` method into\r\n  `CreateJavaSources` for simplicity.\r\n\r\nI made other general refactoring in `GenerateJavaStubs`:\r\n\r\n- Since we don't have to worry about deleting a `temp_map_file`, we\r\n  can return earlier if `Generator.CreateJavaSources` fails.\r\n- A `GetResource\u003cT\u003e` method, cleans up the places reading from\r\n  `EmbeddedResource` files. I also changed it up to properly `Dispose`\r\n  things.\r\n- A `save` anonymous method/delegate should just be a `SaveResource`\r\n  *regular* method.\r\n- A few places were calling `Path.GetFullPath` unecessarily. Since\r\n  this method accesses the file system, we should skip it unless the\r\n  full path is actually needed.\r\n\r\nI also added some tests for the new APIs in `MonoAndroidHelper`.\r\n\r\n## Results ##\r\n\r\nI did three test runs, because I was getting varying times for\r\n`GenerateJavaStubs`. This is the Xamarin.Forms integration project in\r\nthis repo:\r\n\r\n    Before (Clean Build):\r\n    1. 1433 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    2. 1594 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    3. 1353 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n\r\n    After (Clean Build):\r\n    1. 1201 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    2. 1137 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    3. 1136 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n\r\n    Before (Incremental):\r\n    1. 1184 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    2. 1181 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    3. 1172 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n\r\n    After (Incremental):\r\n    1. 1035 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    2. 1049 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    3. 1036 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n\r\n`GenerateJavaStubs` is now about 250ms faster on initial build and\r\n150ms faster on incremental builds.\r\n\r\nI could not see a difference in `GenerateResourceDesigner`, likely\r\nsince it wrote only a single temp file.\r\n\r\nNext steps would be to make changes in other MSBuild tasks as well.","created_at":"2018-12-14 07:07:12 UTC"},{"title":"Update Cake to 0.31.0","issue_url":"https://github.com/jonathanpeppers/glidex/pull/22","repo_name":"jonathanpeppers/glidex","body":"The version used was from 6/12/2017!","created_at":"2018-12-13 22:46:59 UTC"},{"title":"Bump to xamarin/java.interop/master@b57d770","issue_url":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2524","repo_name":"xamarin/xamarin-android","body":"Changes: https://github.com/xamarin/java.interop/compare/706e4cc...b57d770\r\n\r\n[Java.Interop] Target .NET Standard 2.0\r\n\r\n[jcwgen] add public method for GetDestinationPath","created_at":"2018-12-12 15:33:07 UTC"},{"title":"[xa-prep-tasks] \"stream\" http requests","issue_url":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2533","repo_name":"xamarin/xamarin-android","body":"Context: http://build.devdiv.io/2271113\r\nContext: http://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/efficiently-streaming-large-http-responses-with-httpclient\r\n\r\nWe are still getting random OOM errors on Windows/VSTS:\r\n\r\n    android-toolchain.targets(52,5): Error : Unable to download URL `https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r14b-windows-x86_64.zip` to `C:\\Users\\dlab14\\android-archives\\android-ndk-r14b-windows-x86_64.zip`: Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that if you don't specify\r\n`HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead`, then the entire request\r\nbody is buffered into a `MemoryStream`!

The case of `.new` can collide\r\nif two builds are running at once (example caused by a known VS for\r\nMac issue).\r\n\r\nThinking about this, in cases with small files, we can make a simple\r\noptimization:\r\n\r\n- Generate the file in-memory.\r\n- Use a new `MonoAndroidHelper.CopyStreamIfChanged` method`.\r\n\r\nThis has several benefits:\r\n\r\n- We never write a file to disk when there are no changes.\r\n- We don't have to *remember* to delete the file.\r\n- The code, in general, is slightly simpler.\r\n\r\nThe only place we likely shouldn't use this new pattern, would be if\r\nthe file was huge.\r\n\r\n## Changes ##\r\n\r\nI added new APIs for:\r\n\r\n- `Files.HasStreamChanged` - to compare a `Stream` in memory\r\n- `Files.HasBytesChanged` - to compare a `byte[]` in memory\r\n- `Files.CopyIfStreamChanged`\r\n- `Files.CopyIfStringChanged` - some cases we have a `string`\r\n- `Files.CopyIfBytesChanged` - this supports `string`\r\n- `MonoAndroidHelper.CopyIfStreamChanged`\r\n- `MonoAndroidHelper.CopyIfStringChanged`\r\n- `MonoAndroidHelper.CopyIfBytesChanged`\r\n\r\nI changed the following MSBuild tasks, mostly to test out the new\r\nbehavior:\r\n\r\n- `GenerateResourceDesigner` was using a `.new` file.\r\n- `GenerateJavaStubs` was using temp files in many places. I was able\r\n  to fix up all the places except where `Generator.CreateJavaSources`\r\n  writes Java code to an output directory.\r\n\r\nI made other general refactoring in `GenerateJavaStubs`:\r\n\r\n- The top-level `temp` directory we still use, should be deleted in a\r\n  `try-finally`!\r\n- Since we don't have to worry about deleting a `temp_map_file`, we\r\n  can return earlier if `Generator.CreateJavaSources` fails.\r\n- A `GetResource\u003cT\u003e` method, cleans up the places reading from\r\n  `EmbeddedResource` files. I also changed it up to properly `Dispose`\r\n  things.\r\n- A `save` anonymous method/delegate should just be a `SaveResource`\r\n  *regular* method.\r\n- A few places were calling `Path.GetFullPath` unecessarily. Since\r\n  this method accesses the file system, we should skip it unless the\r\n  full path is actually needed.\r\n\r\nI also added some tests for the new APIs in `MonoAndroidHelper`.\r\n\r\n## Results ##\r\n\r\nI did three test runs, because I was getting varying times for\r\n`GenerateJavaStubs`. This is the Xamarin.Forms integration project in\r\nthis repo:\r\n\r\n    Before (Clean Build):\r\n    1. 1587 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    2. 1503 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    3. 1553 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n\r\n    After (Clean Build):\r\n    1. 1424 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    2. 1461 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    3. 1529 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n\r\n    Before (Incremental):\r\n    1. 1775 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    2. 1490 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    3. 1664 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n\r\n    After (Incremental):\r\n    1. 1443 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    2. 1480 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    3. 1589 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n\r\n`GenerateJavaStubs` is now consistently faster, but it's hard to tell\r\nhow much. I feel it is likely 100ms better. I have an SSD, so I'd\r\nexpect developers with an HDD to see even bigger improvments.\r\n\r\nI could not see a difference in `GenerateResourceDesigner`, likely\r\nsince it wrote only a single temp file.\r\n\r\nNext steps would be to make changes in Java.Interop so we could get\r\nthe same `CopyIfStreamChanged` behavior for *all* generated Java\r\nfiles. There are likely other MSBuild tasks to change as well.","created_at":"2018-12-07 20:14:01 UTC"},{"title":"[build] Makefile should run /t:Restore after dependencies.csproj","issue_url":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2502","repo_name":"xamarin/xamarin-android","body":"We want the Mono upgrade to run *before* we run `/t:Restore`.\r\n\r\nIn one case downstream in monodroid, we encountered:\r\n\r\n    error MSB4244: The SDK resolver assembly \"/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/5.16.0/lib/mono/msbuild/15.0/bin/SdkResolvers/Microsoft.Build.NuGetSdkResolver/..\\..\\Microsoft.Build.NuGetSdkResolver.dll\" could not be loaded.

It appears that Mono.Cecil goes\r\nand reads for attributes, and so this work is done twice when\r\nattributes exist. I went through and removed any checks for `Has*` in\r\n`Java.Interop.Tools.Cecil`, as I could see a benefit in Visual\r\nStudio's profiler: the % time taken went down in these methods when\r\n`Has*` was removed.\r\n\r\nAnother instance I found `MethodDefinitionRocks.GetBaseDefinition` had\r\na lot of LINQ:\r\n\r\n    var baseMethod = method.DeclaringType.GetBaseTypes ()\r\n        .SelectMany (t

            m.HasParameters == method.HasParameters \u0026\u0026\r\n                (!m.HasParameters\r\n                    ? true\r\n                    : AreParametersCompatibleWith (m.Parameters, method.Parameters)))\r\n        .FirstOrDefault ();\r\n\r\nI switched this to a `foreach` loop, and removed the `HasParameters`\r\nchecks.\r\n\r\nWhen testing these changes in xamarin-android, there was a noticeable\r\nimprovement to `GenerateJavaStubs`:\r\n\r\n    Before\r\n    1414 ms  GenerateJavaStubs                          1 calls\r\n    After\r\n    1355 ms  GenerateJavaStubs

What is confusing, is this was an incremental build where everything should already be loaded. The JIT's work should be done already? I don't see the same behavior for Android MSBuild tasks or Windows App SDK tasks.\r\n\r\nThe cause appears to be usage of `[LoadInSeparateAppDomain]` in .NET MAUI.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can't just *remove this* as there would be complications...\r\n\r\n`[LoadInSeparateAppDomain]` also conveniently resets all `static` state when `\u003cXamlCTask/\u003e` runs again. Meaning that future incremental builds would potentially use old (garbage) values. There are several places that cache Mono.Cecil objects for performance reasons. Really weird bugs would result if we didn't address this.\r\n\r\nTo make things correct *and* remove `[LoadInSeparateAppDomain]`:\r\n\r\n* Move all `static` state to a `XamlCache` class as instance values.\r\n\r\n* Each `ILContext` has an instance of `XamlCache`.\r\n\r\n* Any child `ILContext`'s such as with `DataTemplate` are passed the parent's `XamlCache`.\r\n\r\n* Various `static` extension methods now require a `XamlCache` to be passed in. This allows unit tests to do this as well.\r\n\r\n* Other `*Visitor` or `*Converter` types have an instance of `ILContext`, so they can access `ILContext.Cache` as needed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I had to make small changes to lots of lines for this.\r\n\r\nTesting these changes inside Visual Studio with a `dotnet new maui` project template:\r\n\r\n    Before:\r\n    XamlCTask = 743 ms\r\n    XamlCTask = 706 ms\r\n    XamlCTask = 692 ms\r\n    After:\r\n    XamlCTask = 128 ms\r\n    XamlCTask = 134 ms\r\n    XamlCTask = 117 ms\r\n\r\nThis saves about ~587ms on incremental builds on all platforms, an 82% improvement. This will help even more on large solutions with multiple .NET MAUI projects, where `\u003cXamlCTask/\u003e` runs multiple times.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-08 21:51:40 UTC"},{"title":"[workload] remove Microsoft.Android.Sdk.BundleTool pack","issue_url":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/6589","repo_name":"xamarin/xamarin-android","body":"This reverts 291a43e2a7fcf91bb73499e0b2b50c3b09d0cc29.\r\n\r\nInitially, we were trying to make some workload packs optional in .NET\r\n6.

pass `natsorted` (or something) to [SQLAlchemy Custom Comparators](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/operators.html#operator-customization), but that bore little fruit. My understanding is that whatever custom comparisons added to the `order_by` of the relationship would be performed SQL-side, so we'd not be able use the Python library, and might have to implement a migration to add a stored function to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nI also considered adding [`__gt__`-style operators](https://docs.python.org/3.8/reference/datamodel.html#object.__gt__) to `File` class, and then using Python's default `.sort()` or `sorted()`, but that also seemed wrong, since it would apply filename-based sorting to the entire class. I also pursued this in hopes of using [Jinja2 `sort()`](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#jinja-filters.sort) directly in the template - but it has the same problem of not using natural sorting.\r\n\r\nFinally, I landed on performing the sort in the view, which felt like the right balance.\r\n\r\nNote: in trove-classifiers, the sort order is 2.7 =\u003e 3.9 =\u003e 3.10 - and I reverse the order here - happy to change that, but I felt like the most recent files are going to be more readily useful to a user.","created_at":"2021-12-03 20:03:49 UTC"}]},{"id":27190,"nickname":"oSumAtrIX","gravatar_id":"","github_profile":"https://github.com/oSumAtrIX","twitter_profile":null,"contributions_count":20,"organisations":[{"login":"revanced","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101597779?size=80","link":"https://24pullrequests.com/organisations/revanced"}],"link":"https://24pullrequests.com/users/oSumAtrIX","pull_requests":[{"title":"docs: init","issue_url":"https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/pull/1232","repo_name":"revanced/revanced-patches","body":"## TODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] APIs","created_at":"2022-12-09 19:03:58 UTC"},{"title":"Add alternative way to get server name","issue_url":"https://github.com/oSumAtrIX/BetterDiscordPlugins/pull/14","repo_name":"oSumAtrIX/BetterDiscordPlugins","body":"","created_at":"2021-12-09 19:36:18 UTC"},{"title":"Format dislikes the same way likes are formatted","issue_url":"https://github.com/Anarios/return-youtube-dislike/pull/202","repo_name":"Anarios/return-youtube-dislike","body":"Change function `numberFormat` to match the formatting on YouTube\r\nRelated issue: #201","created_at":"2021-12-05 06:57:30 UTC"},{"title":"chore: merge branch `dev` to `main`","issue_url":"https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/pull/1235","repo_name":"revanced/revanced-patches","body":"","created_at":"2022-12-10 10:18:33 UTC"},{"title":"ci: check code quality on pull requests for branch `dev`","issue_url":"https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patcher/pull/132","repo_name":"revanced/revanced-patcher","body":"","created_at":"2022-12-11 02:15:21 UTC"},{"title":"ci: open pull requests to merge `dev` to `main`","issue_url":"https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patcher/pull/131","repo_name":"revanced/revanced-patcher","body":"","created_at":"2022-12-11 02:12:45 UTC"},{"title":"ci: do not trigger on push to branch `dev`","issue_url":"https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patcher/pull/135","repo_name":"revanced/revanced-patcher","body":"","created_at":"2022-12-11 04:00:49 UTC"},{"title":"ci: do not trigger on push to branch `dev`","issue_url":"https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/pull/1238","repo_name":"revanced/revanced-patches","body":"","created_at":"2022-12-11 04:00:10 UTC"},{"title":"ci: open pull requests to merge `dev` to `main`","issue_url":"https://github.com/revanced/revanced-cli/pull/164","repo_name":"revanced/revanced-cli","body":"","created_at":"2022-12-11 04:16:45 UTC"},{"title":"feat: trace logs when compatibility annotation is missing","issue_url":"https://github.com/revanced/revanced-cli/pull/166","repo_name":"revanced/revanced-cli","body":"This PR uses tracing logs when the compatibility annotation is missing instead of warning about it.

references to SPFx, I separated the NavLinkBuilder into its own component.\r\nAlso, I set collectCoverage to false, as coverage collection is currently broken, and I see no easy way to fix this.\r\n\r\nThe NavLinkBuilder was modifying arrays in place, as well as returning the modifications. While this was probably not the cause of the error, I fixed this by not returning the modifications anymore.\r\n\r\nI changed the algorithm from counting the depth up, to counting the order down to 0. Thus, I could remove the depth entirely. This simplified the algorithm and resolved the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-22 04:19:12 UTC"},{"title":"Release/0.1.0","issue_url":"https://github.com/nils-org/GitHubMilestoneCleaner/pull/22","repo_name":"nils-org/GitHubMilestoneCleaner","body":"","created_at":"2022-11-30 19:33:35 UTC"},{"title":"(#13) fixed the removal of the existing input","issue_url":"https://github.com/nils-org/StatiqExtensions.WebFingerAlias/pull/14","repo_name":"nils-org/StatiqExtensions.WebFingerAlias","body":"fixes #13 ","created_at":"2022-12-03 00:49:17 UTC"},{"title":"Release/0.1.0 beta1","issue_url":"https://github.com/nils-org/StatiqExtensions.WebFingerAlias/pull/12","repo_name":"nils-org/StatiqExtensions.WebFingerAlias","body":"","created_at":"2022-12-02 11:17:05 UTC"},{"title":"add well-known/webfinger","issue_url":"https://github.com/nils-a/linktree/pull/4","repo_name":"nils-a/linktree","body":"","created_at":"2022-12-04 11:01:55 UTC"},{"title":"Release/4.0.0","issue_url":"https://github.com/cake-contrib/cake.asciidoctorj/pull/187","repo_name":"cake-contrib/cake.asciidoctorj","body":"","created_at":"2022-12-06 09:35:06 UTC"},{"title":"Release/3.0.0","issue_url":"https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Gradle/pull/282","repo_name":"cake-contrib/Cake.Gradle","body":"","created_at":"2022-12-06 10:02:48 UTC"},{"title":"(maint) update bootstrappers to newest version","issue_url":"https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Grunt/pull/19","repo_name":"cake-contrib/Cake.Grunt","body":"This fixed the error in AppVeyor, and also bumps the\r\nbootstrappers to the newest version.","created_at":"2022-12-04 21:23:42 UTC"},{"title":"Update CI to use Cake.Recipe 3.x","issue_url":"https://github.com/juro-org/Cake.SPCAF/pull/80","repo_name":"juro-org/Cake.SPCAF","body":"this PR supersedes #58","created_at":"2022-12-08 09:46:37 UTC"}]}]
